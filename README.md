# Nashville_Housing_Data_Cleaning_Project

## Overview

This project involves cleaning and transforming the Nashville Housing Data to prepare it for analysis. The data cleaning process includes standardizing date formats, handling missing and duplicate values, splitting address components into individual columns, and converting categorical values for consistency.

## Project Objectives

- Standardize the date format of `SaleDate`.
- Populate missing property addresses by merging available data.
- Break down address information into separate columns for address, city, and state.
- Update categorical fields for consistency (e.g., convert '0' and '1' to 'NO' and 'YES').
- Remove duplicate records based on specific criteria.
- Clean up the dataset by removing unused columns.
